I've been asked in various occasions for recommendations and tips when traveling to Colombia. The people that know me, are aware that I talk a lot about Colombia and about my life growing in Bogota.

Conversations about Colombia, often end up in someone knowing someone that have been to Colombia or is planning to go to Colombia. And often, I end up volunteering to provide tips, guidance to get what I consider, an awesome experience while in my Country.

So instead of continuing sending out individual messages with recommendations about Colombia, why not posting them out there in the Internet so other could potentially find them? So here they are, let's start with my city: Bogota
<!--more-->
Bogota is a very large city that much like any other major city in the world like NYC, Paris or Sao Paulo is live 24x7. These days the traffic has been really bad so be prepared to spend time in traffic jams, so avoid as much as you can to move around during peak times. 7 - 9 a.m in the mornings and 4-7 at night.

If you have a smartphone with an active data plan on your phone. I encourage you to download [Tappsi](http://tappsi.co/), so you can order taxis in a similar way to Lift or Uber in a secure and comfortable way. Also, [Uber](https://www.uber.com/cities/bogota) is active in Bogota and the prices similar to the US.

I'm going to start covering those areas in the city that are located in the northern part:

### Usaquen
<p style='text-align: center; font-weight: bold;'>What used to be a small town located in the outskirts of the city, it's now a neighbourhood. Though it is one of the most vibrant areas where you can find great restaurants and bars. You could literally try different things in every visit.</p>
