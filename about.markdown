I'm Juan Camilo Ruiz, Colombian product leader living in Dublin, Ireland. currently working in Decentralized Identities [@Microsoft](https://aka.ms/ownyouridentity), former PM [@BigCommerce](https://bigcommerce.com) where my team and I built the first version of BC's [page builder](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Page-Builder?language=en_US), [@Moovweb](https://moovforge.com/) where I worked building awesome mobile e-commerce products and [@Oracle](https://developer.oracle.com/visual-builder/) evolving their first web application framework and development tools.

This is my personal blog and sandbox to learn and geek out with things that I found in the web. I'm a firm believer in knowledge sharing and this blog is my way to share stuff I've learned in my journey and that someday someone could find useful. The opinions are my own and do not represent any of my employers.

## How could you start a conversation with me?
* Talk to me about FÃºtbol (the real one)
* Talk about best local coffee shops
* Share a random fact about Colombia that is not related to Narcos.
